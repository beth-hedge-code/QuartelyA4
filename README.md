Friday project: Quarterly Assessment 4

Goal: create an AI-Powered News Newsletter Generator that automates the process of keeping users informed about the latest news.

You want a system that:
    1) fetches the latest news by retrieving articles on topics of interest from reliable sources. 
    2) summarizes the main points with an LLM to condense the lengthy article into a concise email-friendly summary, and 
    3) deliver the information via email to recipients. Since this email should be “automated,” you can do this by scheduling a script to
    run daily using a task scheduler (e.g., cron on macOS/Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows). It should run your python file.
